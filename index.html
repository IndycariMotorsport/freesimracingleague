        <div class="des1"><p></p><p>During Quarantine, Indycar did their iRacing challenges, which got many people into iRacing, but many people do not have the time, money, or equipment for iRacing, many of those people have an Xbox with Forza Motorsport 7. So what about a controlled race on Forza? Even better, what about a season? Indycars, Indycar fans, and a good time!</p><p></p></div>

<div class="des2"><p>Each person who signs up will need a number, make their paint scheme, and pick out a sponsor. You will have a choice of going for the championship and racing every race of the season or doing a couple of races as a guest. As a guest, you will still need a number, paint scheme, and sponsor. All this will be decided in a form located in the sing up tab.</p></div>

<div class="des3"><p>The schedule consists of the tracks that the 2021 Indycar season goes to, the tracks that Forza does not have in the season have been replaced by the most similar track in the game. The schedule is in the schedule tab along with the specifics. </p></div>

<div class="des4"><p>We also need 4 officials, the officials can designate one of themselves as the pace car driver. If we get 5, the 5th will be a backup.</p></div></div><br>
